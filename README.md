# Word-on-the-street

This was a very simple mobile application that Noah and I worked on to fulfill the requirements of our Mobile Application Development course a few semesters
ago. 

Using a users GPS location data, we created an Android application that allowed users to leave/view reviews of businesses within a certain proximity
to the location. Our goal was to allow users to see reviews of locations while they were close to it. This would be helpful in scenarios where a user wanted to see
reviews of nearby places that they were contemplating visiting.
